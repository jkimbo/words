So I decided to write a blog as I've heard it does wonders for
[you](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/02/how-to-write-without-writing.html).
I haven't decided what to write as yet and it will most likely be a series of
barely readable conciousness for the time being until I find some kind of focus.
It is also, currently, an exercise in talking to myself as I imagine it will be
a long time (if ever) until some other eyes read these words.

I guess I should introduce myself. My name is Jonathan Kim and I am a 23 year
old male living in London making my way in the world as a web developer. I
really have no idea what that title means as the world of the web is so vast now
but for me it basically consists of communicating with computers all day long
and trying to coax them into doing what I want them to do. I am also a fairly
passionate photographer so I have no doubt there will be a few pictures cropping
up here and there as time passes.

Well I guess that is enough to be getting on with. Is this going to be a diary
or more of a self publicity exercise I don't know.

JK
